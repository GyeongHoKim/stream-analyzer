## Quality Gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**CRITICAL**: After ANY code modification, agents MUST:
1. Run `make lint` to verify code quality
2. Fix ALL violations before proceeding
3. Run `make test` if tests exist for modified areas
4. Report quality check results transparently

See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for complete quality standards and governance rules.
